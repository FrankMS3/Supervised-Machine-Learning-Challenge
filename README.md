# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge  
  
Creating and comparing the accuracy of two machine learning models in classifying the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.  
  
The dataset used is located in the Resources folder. You can simply run the code within the "Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb" file to create, fit, and compare the two machine learning models. Markdown boxes are located within this file, detailing my initial prediction of which would be the more accurate model, as well the results and conclusions.
